Description: An implementation of the sample size computation method for network
    models proposed by Constantin et al. (2023) <doi:10.1037/met0000555>.
    The implementation takes the form of a three-step recursive algorithm
    designed to find an optimal sample size given a model specification and a
    performance measure of interest. It starts with a Monte Carlo simulation
    step for computing the performance measure and a statistic at various sample
    sizes selected from an initial sample size range. It continues with a
    monotone curve-fitting step for interpolating the statistic across the entire
    sample size range. The final step employs stratified bootstrapping to quantify
    the uncertainty around the fitted curve.

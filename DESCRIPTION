Description: A general method for conducting sample size analysis for network
    models. The implementation takes the form of a three-step recursive
    algorithm designed to find an optimal sample size given a model
    specification and a performance measure of interest. It starts with a Monte
    Carlo simulation step for computing the performance measure and a statistic
    at various sample sizes selected from an initial sample size range. It
    continues with a monotone curve-fitting step for interpolating the statistic
    across the entire sample size range. The final step employs stratified
    bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty around the fitted curve.

As the field matures and psychological network modeling becomes more prevalent, there is an increasing need to aid researchers with a network approach in mind that plan to collect data. In this paper, we introduce a general method for performing sample size analysis in the context of network models. The method takes the form of a three-step algorithm designed to find an optimal sample size value given a hypothesized network, an outcome measure (e.g., sensitivity), and a statistic of interest (e.g., power). It starts with a Monte Carlo simulation step for computing the outcome measure and the statistic at various sample sizes. It continues with a curve-fitting step for interpolating the statistic. The final step employs bootstrapping to account for the uncertainty around the interpolated curve. The method is implemented in the form of an R package called powerly, freely available on GitHub and CRAN.")])],-1),f=e("p",null,[t("Constantin, M. A., Schuurman, N. K., & Vermunt, J. K. (2025).

\title{Sample Size Analysis for Psychological Networks and More}
\description{
\code{powerly} is a package that implements the method by \href{https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000555}{Constantin et al. (2023)} for conducting sample size
analysis for network models.
}
\details{
The method implemented is implemented in the main function \code{\link[=powerly]{powerly()}}. The
implementation takes the form of a three-step recursive algorithm designed to
find an optimal sample size value given a model specification and an outcome
measure of interest. It starts with a Monte Carlo simulation step for
computing the outcome at various sample sizes. It continues with a monotone
curve-fitting step for interpolating the outcome. The final step employs
stratified bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty around the fitted curve.

- Constantin, M. A., Schuurman, N. K., & Vermunt, J. K. (2023). A General Monte
Carlo Method for Sample Size Analysis in the Context of Network Models.

    > _The network approach to psychology is an increasingly popular framework
    > for studying interactions among variables. As the field matures and
    > psychological network modeling becomes more prevalent, there is an
    > increasing need to aid researchers with a network approach in mind that
    > plan to collect data. In this paper, we introduce a general method for
    > performing sample size analysis in the context of network models. The
    > method takes the form of a three-step algorithm designed to find an
    > optimal sample size value given a hypothesized network, an outcome measure
    > (e.g., sensitivity), and a statistic of interest (e.g., power). It starts
    > with a Monte Carlo simulation step for computing the outcome measure and
    > the statistic at various sample sizes. It continues with a curve-fitting
    > step for interpolating the statistic. The final step employs bootstrapping
    > to account for the uncertainty around the interpolated curve. The method
    > is implemented in the form of an R package called powerly, freely
    > available on GitHub and CRAN._

    > _With the release of `powerly` `v2.0.0` we go beyond just applying the
    > method in [Constantin et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000555)
    > to network models. We provide a sophisticated system that can be
    > intuitively extended to any statistical model and research question._

    > _[`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com/) is a package designed
    > to provide a simple interface for executing tasks in parallel, while also
    > providing functionality for tracking and displaying the progress of the
    > tasks. This package is aimed at two audiences: (1) end-users who want to
    > execute a task in parallel in an interactive `R` session and track the
    > execution progress, and (2) `R` package developers who want to use
    > [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com/) as a solution for
    > parallel processing in their packages._ The
    > [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com/) can also be used in
    > conjunction with the accompanying
    > [`doParabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com/articles/foreach) `R`
    > package to enable
    > [`foreach`](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/foreach) semantics.

# Ideas to consider
[-] Bisectional algorithm for choosing an optimal starting range (i.e., not to wide, not to narrow)
[-] Switch to accelerated bootstrap CI in `StepThree` for better precision.
[-] Reuse Monte Carlo results from previous iterations if they fall within the updated range.
[-] Shiny application for running the method.
